## Description
* Develop a shell script using several Linux commands, enviornment 
variables, pipes, and filters 
* Schedule you shell script to run at specific time intervals using 
**crontab**

## Scenario 

I am assigned the role of lead Linux developer at a top-tech company "ABC 
International INC." ABC currently suffers from a huge bottleneck - each 
day, interns must painstakingly access encrypted password files on core 
servers, and backup those that were updated within the last **24-hours**. 
This 
introduces human error, lowers security, and takes an unreasonable amount 
of work. 

My role is to create a script **backup.sh** which automatically backs up 
any of these files that have been updated within the past 24 hours.
