## Description 
* Explore the anatomy of a DAG, create a DAG and submit it

* The key advantages of Apache Airflowâ€™s approach to representing data pipelines as DAGs is that they are expressed as code, which makes your data pipelines more maintainable, testable, and collaborative

* Create a DAG that runs daily, and extracts user info from **/etc/passwd** file, transform it, and loads it into a file 
* This DAG has two tasks **extract** that extracts fields from /etc/passwd file and **transform_and_load** that transforms and loads data into a file 

## Anatomy of a DAG 
An Apache Airflow DAG is a python program - It consists of these logical blocks:
* Imports 
* DAG Arguments 
* DAG Definition 
* Task Definitions
* Task Pipeline
