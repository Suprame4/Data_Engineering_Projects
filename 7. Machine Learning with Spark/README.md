Apache Spark is an open-source in-memory application framework for distributed data processing and iterative analysis on massive data volumes. Spark is "in-memory" which means that all operations happen within the memory or RAM. 

Also worth noting that Spark is written predominantly in Scala and runs on Java Virtual Machines (JVM)

### Spark Benefits 
Spark checks all the boxes for all the benefits of distributed computing 
* Supports a computing framework for large scale data processing and analysis 
* Provides parallel and distributed processing, scalability and fault tolerance on commodity hardware
