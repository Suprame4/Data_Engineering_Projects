## Description
* This project applies my abilities to work with several NoSQL databases to move and analyze data
* Move data from one type of database to another and run basic queries on various databases
* Use the Cloudant HTTP API 
* Query data in a Cloudant database
* Import data into a MongoDB database
* Query data in a MongoDB database
* Export data from MongoDB
* Import data into a Cassandra database
* Query data in a Cassandra database

## Scenario

I have been assigned the role of data engineer at a Data Consulting Company. Analysts within the office need to work with data on different databases, and with data in different formats. While they are good at analyzing data, they count on me to be able to move data from external sources into various databases, move data from one type of database to another, and be able to run basic queries on various databases. 

## NoSQL Databases
NoSQL Databases used for this lab:
* **MongoDB** (Document)

MongoDB is the most popular document-oriented NoSQL database today, empowering users to query, manipulate, and find interesting insights from their collected data. It can also be used for a variety of purposes because of the flexibility of storing structured or unstructured data.

* **Cassandra** (Column)

Apache Cassandra is an open source database. The right choice when you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Apache Cassandra is currently one of the top ten most popular solutions in the world; itâ€™s a reliable, performant, scalable database for data storage.

* **IBM Cloudant** (Document)

Database-as-a-service **(DBaaS)** is a popular solution for hybrid multi cloud applications. IBM Cloudant is a fully managed DBaaS built on open source Apache CouchDB, Cloudant aims to be the data layer for all your web and mobile applications.
